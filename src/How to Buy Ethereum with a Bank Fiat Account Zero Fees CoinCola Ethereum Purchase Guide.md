## Understanding Ethereum and Fiat Currency  
### What is Ethereum?  
Ethereum is a decentralized blockchain platform that supports smart contracts and decentralized applications (dApps). Its native cryptocurrency, ETH, is the second-largest digital asset by market capitalization and serves as fuel for network transactions and decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols.

### Fiat Currency Fundamentals  
Fiat currencies, such as USD, EUR, or NGN, are government-issued legal tender without intrinsic value. When purchasing Ethereum, users can convert these traditional currencies into ETH using crypto exchanges or peer-to-peer (P2P) platforms.

### Why Choose Fiat-to-ETH Transactions?  
1. **Price Stability**: Fiat currencies provide a stable reference point for crypto purchases.  
2. **Accessibility**: Most users already have access to fiat through bank accounts or cards.  
3. **Regulatory Compliance**: Fiat transactions often align with local financial regulations.
