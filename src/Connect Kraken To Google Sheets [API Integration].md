# Connect Kraken To Google Sheets [API Integration]  

Connecting the Kraken API to Google Sheets enables cryptocurrency traders and analysts to automate data collection, track market trends, and streamline portfolio management. This guide provides a step-by-step approach to integrating Kraken's public API endpoints with Google Sheets using the Apipheny add-on. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced trader, this tutorial will help you harness real-time crypto data efficiently.  

## Why Integrate Kraken API With Google Sheets?  

The Kraken API offers access to critical cryptocurrency market data, including asset information, recent trades, and system status. By integrating this data into Google Sheets, users can:  
- Automate price tracking and portfolio calculations  
- Visualize trends with dynamic charts and graphs  
- Combine crypto data with traditional financial metrics  
- Build custom trading dashboards  

This integration is particularly valuable for traders who rely on real-time analytics to make informed decisions.  

## Step 1: Install the Apipheny Add-On

1. Open Google Sheets and navigate to **Extensions > Add-ons > Get add-ons**.  
2. Search for "Apipheny" in the Google Workspace Marketplace.  
3. Click **Install** to add the tool to your Sheets environment.

After installation, open a new Google Sheet and access Apipheny via **Extensions > Apipheny > Import API**.  

## Step 2: Understand Kraken API Endpoints  

An **API endpoint** is a URL path that returns specific data. Krakenâ€™s public endpoints include:  

| Endpoint Type          | Description                          | Example URL                          |  
|------------------------|--------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|  
| Asset Information      | Retrieves details about tradable assets | `/0/public/Assets`                  |  
| Recent Trades          | Provides trade history for specific pairs | `/0/public/Trades?pair=XBTUSD`     |  
| System Status          | Shows platform operational status      | `/0/public/SystemStatus`            |  

### Key Considerations:  
- **Authentication**: Public endpoints (like those above) donâ€™t require API keys.  
- **Rate Limits**: Kraken imposes limits to prevent abuseâ€”check documentation for specifics.  
- **Data Frequency**: Public endpoints update in real time but may vary by endpoint.  

## Step 3: Configure Your First Kraken API Request  

Follow these steps to retrieve asset information:  

1. **Choose the Method**: Select **GET** in Apiphenyâ€™s method dropdown.  
2. **Enter the API URL**: Use `https://api.kraken.com/0/public/Assets`.  
3. **Headers**: Leave this section blank, as public endpoints donâ€™t require headers.  

Click **Run** in Apipheny to import data into your sheet.  

### Example: Tracking Bitcoin (BTC) Data  
The `Assets` endpoint returns details like:  
- Asset name and symbol  
- Deposit/withdrawal status  
- Trading pair availability  

This data helps traders verify asset compatibility with their strategies.  

## Step 4: Explore Additional Public Endpoints  

### Example 1: Recent Trades  
Retrieve the last 1,000 trades for XBT/USD:  
```  
https://api.kraken.com/0/public/Trades?pair=XBTUSD  
```  
Use this data to analyze market sentiment or detect price patterns.  

### Example 2: System Status  
Check Krakenâ€™s operational status:  
```  
https://api.kraken.com/0/public/SystemStatus  
```  
This endpoint confirms whether Kraken is in normal trading mode.  

## FAQs  

### Q1: Do I Need an API Key for Kraken Public Endpoints?  
**A**: No. Public endpoints like Market Data donâ€™t require authentication.  

### Q2: Can I Automate Data Imports?  
**A**: Yes. Apipheny allows scheduling requests at intervals (e.g., every hour).  

### Q3: What Data Can I Access?  
**A**: Public endpoints provide asset info, trade history, order books, and system status.  

### Q4: Is There a Rate Limit?  
**A**: Kraken limits requests to 15 per minute for public endpoints. Exceeding this may result in temporary bans.  

### Q5: How Do I Troubleshoot Errors?  
**A**: Common issues include invalid URLs or rate limit breaches. Verify the endpoint URL and check Krakenâ€™s documentation for error codes.  

## Advanced Use Cases  

### Portfolio Tracker Template  
Combine the `Assets` and `Trades` endpoints to build a live portfolio tracker:  
1. Import asset balances from Kraken.  
2. Calculate USD values using the `Trades` endpoint.  
3. Visualize gains/losses with Google Sheets charts.  

### Market Sentiment Analysis  
Use recent trade data to identify buying/selling trends. For example, a surge in XBT/USD trades might signal bullish sentiment.  

## Best Practices  

1. **Monitor Rate Limits**: Use Apiphenyâ€™s scheduling feature to avoid exceeding Krakenâ€™s limits.  
2. **Validate Data**: Cross-check API results with Krakenâ€™s website for accuracy.  
3. **Secure Sensitive Data**: Avoid storing API keys or credentials in public sheets.
