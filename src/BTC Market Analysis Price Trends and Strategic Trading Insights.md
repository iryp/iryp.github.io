## Conclusion and Forward Outlook  

While BTC's immediate trajectory appears bearish, technical indicators suggest potential for a mean reversion toward $20,000â€“$20,500. Traders should remain vigilant for macroeconomic catalysts, including the upcoming CPI report and Fed commentary. A decisive close above $22,000 would invalidate the current bearish bias, opening avenues for retesting $25,000.
