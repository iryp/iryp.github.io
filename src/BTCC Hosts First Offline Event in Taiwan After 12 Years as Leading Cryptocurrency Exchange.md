### BTCC's Risk Management Perspective  

Taka highlighted BTCC's observations about shifting risk perceptions among Taiwanese traders:  
- **2018-2020**: 72% of new users lacked basic risk management knowledge  
- **2021-2023**: This figure dropped to 41% as educational campaigns gained traction  

"Contract trading requires discipline," Taka emphasized. "Our platform focuses on providing tools â€“ like stop-loss orders and position sizing calculators â€“ that help users implement these principles."  

### Regulatory Readiness in Asia  

Jim addressed the importance of compliance in event planning:  
1. Partnering with local legal advisors  
2. Implementing KYC protocols for attendee verification  
3. Aligning content with Taiwan's Financial Supervisory Commission guidelines  

## BTCC's Commitment to Security: 12 Years Without Incidents  

Taka reinforced BTCC's security credentials during the Q&A session:  
- **Cold storage solutions**: 98% of user funds stored offline  
- **Regulatory compliance**: Holds licenses in the US, Canada, and EU  
- **Asset segregation**: User deposits never commingled with operational funds  

The exchange's exclusive focus on contract trading â€“ rather than diversifying into spot markets or DeFi products â€“ was framed as a strategic advantage. "Simplification reduces attack vectors," Taka stated. "By specializing in what we do best, we minimize operational risks for users."  

## Future Plans: Listening to the Taiwan Market  

BTCC's roadmap for 2024 includes:  
- Quarterly educational workshops across Taiwan  
- Launch of a localized Mandarin-language support center  
- Integration of AI-driven risk assessment tools
