A correlation of **0.38** between Binance Coin and Cardano over the past 90 days indicates a **very weak positive relationship**. This suggests limited overlap in price movements, presenting modest diversification potential when combining both assets.

## Diversification Opportunities

### Why Diversify?
Diversifying across cryptocurrencies can reduce unsystematic riskâ€”the inherent risk of individual assets. By holding both BNB.CC and ADA.CC, investors may mitigate sector-specific volatility, though the weak correlation limits the effect. The overlapping risk portion (38%) that can be diversified away highlights the importance of pairing assets with low or negative correlations.

#### Strategic Insight
A 0.38 correlation implies that **62% of the risk** associated with these assets is non-diversifiable (market risk), while the remaining 38% could be reduced through hedging strategies.

   - BNB.CCâ€™s lower volatility (3.08x less risky) makes it a stable long-position candidate.
