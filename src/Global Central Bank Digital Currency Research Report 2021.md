# Global Central Bank Digital Currency Research Report 2021  

## Key Findings from the BIS Survey  

Since 2017, the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) has conducted annual surveys to assess central banks' engagement with central bank digital currencies (CBDCs). The 2021 survey gathered responses from 65 central banks, representing 72% of the global population and 91% of economic output. Key insights include:  

- **Rising Participation**: Over 86% of surveyed central banks are actively exploring CBDC initiatives, with 60% advancing to proof-of-concept (POC) stages and 14% launching pilot programs.  
- **Geographic Trends**: Participation correlates with digital infrastructure maturity. High mobile penetration, internet access, and innovation capacity drive engagement, while smaller jurisdictions with limited resources lag behind.  
- **Focus on Retail Applications**: Most efforts concentrate on retail CBDCs for everyday transactions, reflecting priorities like financial inclusion and payment efficiency.

## Regional Priorities in CBDC Development  

### Emerging Markets and Financial Inclusion  

Emerging economies prioritize retail CBDCs to expand financial access. The Bahamas exemplifies this approach through its **Sand Dollar** initiative, launched in 2019. As an archipelago with 390,000 residents spread across 30 inhabited islands, the country faced challenges with traditional banking infrastructure. Physical bank branches were scarce, creating barriers to financial services.  

The Sand Dollar addressed these issues by enabling digital transactions via mobile devices, reaching unbanked populations and reducing reliance on cash. This aligns with the broader goal of **financial inclusion**, a critical driver for CBDC adoption in developing economies.  

### Advanced Economies: Monetary Sovereignty and Stability  

Advanced economies emphasize CBDCs as tools to safeguard monetary sovereignty amid the rise of private cryptocurrencies and digital dollarization. While they acknowledge the potential of CBDCs to enhance payment systems, their primary motivation centers on:  
- **Mitigating Currency Substitution**: Preventing erosion of domestic currencies due to foreign digital currencies.  
- **Financial Stability**: Ensuring central banks retain control over monetary policy frameworks.  

However, advanced economies view CBDCs as complementary rather than transformative for monetary policy implementation.  

## Technical and Strategic Challenges  

### Stages of Implementation  

The BIS survey highlights varying stages of CBDC development:  
| Stage               | Percentage of Central Banks |  
|---------------------|----------------------------|  
| Research Phase      | 20%                        |  
| Proof of Concept    | 60%                        |  
| Pilot Programs      | 14%                        |  
| No Active Work      | 6%                         |  

### Cross-Cutting Concerns  

1. **Privacy vs. Security**: Balancing user anonymity with regulatory requirements for anti-money laundering (AML).  
2. **Interoperability**: Ensuring CBDC systems integrate with existing payment infrastructures.  
3. **Cybersecurity Risks**: Protecting digital currency networks from hacking and fraud.  

## Future Outlook  

The survey underscores CBDCs as a strategic priority for central banks globally. While implementation timelines vary, the consensus is clear: digital currencies are reshaping the financial landscape. Key trends include:  
- **Collaborative Innovation**: Cross-border partnerships to standardize CBDC frameworks.  
- **Hybrid Models**: Combining centralized and decentralized technologies to optimize efficiency and control.  
- **Regulatory Evolution**: Adapting legal frameworks to address novel risks associated with digital currencies.
