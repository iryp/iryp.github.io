# Hong Kong Bank Launches First 24/7 Crypto Trading Service with Zero Commissions Until Mid-2025

The cryptocurrency market has entered a new bull phase, with Bitcoin (BTC) prices surging past $97,000 as regulatory optimism grows following Donald Trump's U.S. presidential election win. In this rapidly evolving landscape, ZA Bank has become Hong Kong's first financial institution to offer retail investors direct 24/7 crypto trading capabilities through its digital platform.

## Market Dynamics Driving Institutional Adoption

The renewed interest in virtual assets stems from shifting regulatory expectations in the United States, where industry participants anticipate more crypto-friendly policies under the new administration. This market sentiment has fueled a 160% year-over-year increase in Bitcoin's valuation, with the leading cryptocurrency briefly approaching the $100,000 milestone.

ZA Bank's strategic move positions the institution at the forefront of crypto finance, leveraging its unique status as the only licensed bank in Hong Kong authorized to provide virtual asset trading services under the Securities and Futures Commission's (SFC) comprehensive account framework.

## Pioneering 24/7 Crypto Trading Infrastructure

As the first Hong Kong bank to offer round-the-clock crypto transactions, ZA Bank has developed a robust trading infrastructure that accommodates the global nature of blockchain markets. Key service features include:

- **Minimum Investment Threshold**: $600 HKD (approximately $77 USD) per transaction
- **Supported Cryptocurrencies**: Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) initially
- **Trading Hours**: Continuous operation across all seven days of the week
- **Platform Accessibility**: Available exclusively through the bank's mobile application

The bank invested over 12 months in developing secure blockchain integration while navigating complex regulatory requirements.
