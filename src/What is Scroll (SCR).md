# What is Scroll (SCR)?

Scroll (SCR) is a groundbreaking Layer-2 scaling solution designed to enhance Ethereum's scalability and performance through cutting-edge zkEVM technology. As the 60th project launched on Binance's popular Launchpool platform, SCR has quickly become a focal point for crypto enthusiasts and developers alike.

## Understanding Scroll's Core Functionality

Scroll operates as a complementary layer to Ethereum's main network, optimizing transaction processing while maintaining security. Its architecture leverages **zero-knowledge rollups (zk-rollups)** to achieve remarkable efficiency gains. By executing transactions off-chain and submitting compressed data for verification on Ethereum, Scroll significantly reduces network congestion without compromising decentralization.

This innovative approach enables:
- Faster transaction speeds
- Lower gas fees
- Enhanced developer experience

## Key Features of Scroll

Scroll's zkEVM implementation delivers several transformative capabilities:

### Scalability Breakthrough
By processing transactions off-chain, Scroll achieves throughput improvements of up to **100x** compared to Ethereum's base layer. This dramatically reduces network congestion during peak usage periods.

### Seamless Ethereum Compatibility
Developers benefit from full **EVM bytecode compatibility**, allowing effortless migration of existing Ethereum DApps without code modifications. This feature has accelerated adoption among Web3 builders.

### Cost Optimization
Batch processing of transactions reduces per-transaction costs by up to **90%**, making decentralized applications more accessible to mainstream users.

### Enhanced Security Model
Zk-rollups maintain Ethereum's security guarantees through cryptographic proofs, ensuring transaction validity without requiring trust in intermediaries.

## How Scroll's Architecture Works

### Rollup Mechanics
Scroll employs **zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs)** to verify off-chain transactions. This approach:
1. Processes transactions off-chain
2. Aggregates them into batches
3. Submits validity proofs to Ethereum
4. Finalizes transactions on Layer 1

Compared to optimistic rollups, this method eliminates withdrawal periods and provides immediate finality.

### Three-Layer Structure

| Layer | Function | Key Components |
|-------|----------|----------------|
| Settlement | Final verification | Ethereum mainnet |
| Sequencing | Transaction ordering | Batch processors |
| Proving | Validity proofs | Distributed prover network |

### Zero-Knowledge Ethereum Virtual Machine (zkEVM)
Scroll's zkEVM implementation maintains full compatibility with Ethereum while enabling:
- Native support for Solidity and Vyper smart contracts
- Reduced infrastructure costs for developers
- Faster iteration cycles for DApp upgrades

## The Role of SCR Tokens

The SCR token serves as the ecosystem's native utility token with multiple applications:

### Governance
Token holders participate in protocol decisions through:
- Voting on parameter changes
- Approving system upgrades
- Allocating treasury funds

### Network Operations
Two key participant roles:
1. **Provers**: Generate cryptographic proofs for transaction batches
2. **Sequencers**: Organize transactions and submit batches to Ethereum

Both roles receive SCR rewards for maintaining network security and performance.

### Staking Mechanism
Users can stake SCR to:
- Secure the network against attacks
- Earn yield through inflationary rewards
- Participate in governance
