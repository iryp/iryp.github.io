## Bitcoin's Meteoric Rise: A New Benchmark in Currency Valuation  

According to *Bitcoin Magazine*, Bitcoin (BTC) has achieved a historic milestone by surpassing the monetary value of Taiwan's M2 money supply. With a total valuation of **19,785,378 BTC**, Bitcoin now exceeds the M2 metric of New Taiwan Dollar (TWD), which stands at **19,760,251 BTC**. This positions Bitcoin as the **12th largest currency globally** by this unique valuation method.  

For context, Taiwan's M2 monetary supply equates to approximately **NT$63 trillion** (roughly **$1.976 trillion USD**), reflecting Bitcoin's growing dominance in the global financial ecosystem. The M2 metric, which includes cash, checking deposits, and easily convertible near money, serves as a critical indicator of a nation's liquidity and economic health.

## Expert Insights: Caution Amidst Optimism  

While Bitcoin's trajectory remains bullish, Galaxy Digital CEO Michael Novogratz warns of potential short-term corrections. He attributes this to excessive market leverage, stating:  

> "Bitcoin's march toward $100,000 seems inevitable, but a correction is brewing. Markets are over-leveraged, and a reset is likely."  

Novogratz emphasizes that while Bitcoin may dip, it's unlikely to fall below **$80,000** (pre-Trump election levels). He also advises investors to prioritize direct BTC holdings over leveraged assets like MicroStrategy stock, which he believes could face sharper declines.
