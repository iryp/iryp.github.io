## Understanding Crypto Networks on Binance  

Binance supports multiple blockchain networks, each with unique technical specifications and use cases. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the most commonly used networks:  

| **Network**       | **Full Name**                          | **Use Case**                          |  
|--------------------|----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|  
| **BEP2**           | BNB Beacon Chain (Legacy)              | Binance Chain ecosystem                |  
| **BEP20**          | BNB Smart Chain                        | Smart contracts, BSC-based tokens      |  
| **ERC20**          | Ethereum Network                       | Ethereum-based tokens                  |  
| **TRC20**          | TRON Network                           | High-speed, low-cost TRON ecosystem    |  
| **EOS**            | Enterprise Operation System            | EOSIO-based assets                     |  
| **BTC**            | Bitcoin Network                        | Bitcoin transactions                   |  
| **BTC (SegWit)**   | Segregated Witness (Bech32)            | Bitcoin with lower fees, faster speeds|  

**Key Insight**: Always verify network compatibility between platforms to avoid irreversible fund loss.

## Selecting the Right Network: Best Practices  

1. **Match External Platform Requirements**:  
   If transferring from a wallet or exchange that only supports **ERC20**, ensure Binanceâ€™s deposit address uses the same network.  

2. **Prioritize Compatibility Over Fees**:  
   While some networks offer lower transaction costs, incompatible selections (e.g., sending BEP20 tokens to an ERC20 address) result in permanent fund loss.  

3. **Double-Check Address and Memo**:  
   Networks like **BEP2** and **EOS** require a **Memo** field to identify recipients. Omitting this leads to failed transactions.

## Step-by-Step: Withdrawing Cryptocurrency  

Use these steps to withdraw funds from Binance:  

1. **Access Wallet > Withdraw**:  
   Select the cryptocurrency and network consistent with the receiving platform.  

2. **Enter Recipient Details**:  
   Paste the external walletâ€™s address or scan its QR code.  

3. **Verify Network and Amount**:  
   Mismatches at this stage are irreversible.  

4. **Confirm Transaction**:  
   Use 2FA for security and wait for blockchain confirmation (typically 10â€“30 minutes for BTC/ETH).

## Frequently Asked Questions  

**Q: What happens if I use the wrong network?**  
A: Funds sent via an incompatible network are permanently lost. Always cross-verify addresses and network types.  

**Q: How do I choose between BEP20 and ERC20?**  
A: Use **BEP20** for BSC-based wallets (e.g., Trust Wallet) and **ERC20** for Ethereum-compatible wallets (e.g., MetaMask).  

**Q: Are there fees for deposits or withdrawals?**  
A: Binance charges minimal blockchain fees (varies by network congestion). Fees for **BEP20** are typically $0.10â€“$0.50.  

**Q: Why do some networks require a Memo?**  
A: Networks like **EOS** use Memos to identify recipients within shared wallet addresses.
