# Mining Is Getting Harder: What Ethereum Miners Are Best for New Users?

The cryptocurrency landscape has entered a challenging phase. Regulatory pressures and market volatility have created a prolonged bear cycle, with industry veterans like Xue Manzi predicting a downturn lasting up to two years. While this uncertainty has rattled investors, it also signals a necessary correction that could strengthen blockchain's long-term foundations.

## Ethereum's Resilience in a Bear Market

Despite the market's struggles, Ethereum maintains its position as the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. This resilience stems from its unique role as a **blockchain platform** enabling decentralized applications (DApps) through smart contracts. Unlike Bitcoin's singular monetary function, Ethereum's programmable nature has fostered over 100 enterprise-grade implementations spanning:

- Decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms
- Supply chain management systems
- Healthcare data solutions
- Digital identity frameworks

CSDN founder Jiang Tao recently emphasized Ethereum's development ecosystem as the gold standard for DApp creation, noting its superior compatibility and extensibility compared to competing blockchains.

**FAQ: Why Choose Ethereum During a Bear Market?**  
Q: Isn't Ethereum too risky during market downturns?  
A: While short-term volatility exists, Ethereum's foundational role in blockchain infrastructure makes it a safer bet than speculative altcoins. Its integration with real-world applications provides inherent value beyond speculative trading.

## Evolution of Ethereum Mining Difficulty

Mining difficulty has increased dramatically since Ethereum's inception. Data from Etherscan reveals:

| Year | Mining Difficulty (TH/s) | % Increase YoY |
|------|--------------------------|----------------|
| 2017 | 100                      | -              |
| 2018 | 242                      | 142%           |
| 2023 | 4,200+                   | ~10-15% annually |

This exponential growth underscores the importance of selecting appropriate mining hardware for new entrants.
