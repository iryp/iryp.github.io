# PublicAI Secures $10M to Build the Human Layer of AI  

## Introduction to PublicAI's Funding Milestone  

PublicAI, the San Francisco-based Web3-powered AI platform, has successfully raised **$10 million** in funding to develop its groundbreaking "human layer of AI" infrastructure. This innovative framework empowers global participants to contribute training data and engage in real-time AI decision-making through human-in-the-loop (HITL) mechanisms. The funding round includes an $8 million Series A led by prominent investors such as Saudi Telecom Group, Blockchain Builders Fund, and NEAR Foundation, following an initial $2 million raise from IOBC Capital and Solana Foundation. Backed by the Stanford Blockchain Accelerator, PublicAI is positioned at the intersection of blockchain technology and AI evolution.

## The Human Layer: Bridging AI and Humanity  

As AI systems increasingly automate routine tasks, PublicAI addresses the critical need for human involvement in both training and inference stages. Unlike traditional approaches focusing solely on data labeling, PublicAI's decentralized workforce validates AI outputs in real time, ensuring ethical decision-making and adaptability. This human layer operates independently from training data, creating a dynamic feedback loop that maintains AI reliability amid rapid technological shifts.  

### Why Human-in-the-Loop AI Matters  

- **Real-Time Validation**: Human reviewers ensure AI-generated outputs align with real-world contexts.  
- **Bias Mitigation**: Diverse global contributors reduce algorithmic biases inherent in synthetic datasets.  
- **Economic Opportunity**: Enables 1 million+ participants worldwide to earn through meaningful AI collaboration.  

## Addressing Synthetic Data Limitations  

A recent Nature study highlights a growing crisis: AI models trained on synthetic data experience performance collapse. PublicAI's emphasis on verified human contributions directly counters this issue. By prioritizing authentic data sources, the platform has achieved:  
- **$14M+ client revenue**  
- **1M+ global contributors**  
- **Enterprise-grade accuracy** across multiple industries
