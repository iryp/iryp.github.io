## Breakdown of Campaign Tasks  

To claim rewards, participants must complete four sequential tasks. Letâ€™s explore each in detail:  

### 1. Learn About Sui: Educational Modules  
The campaign begins with **five short introductions** to Suiâ€™s core concepts, including its consensus mechanism, Move programming language, and transaction processing. These materials are accessible throughout the campaign period, allowing users to revisit topics for clarity.  

**Pro Tip:** Take notes while studyingâ€”key details will appear in the subsequent quiz.  

### 2. Take the Sui Knowledge Quiz  
After reviewing the materials, participants face a **five-question quiz** testing their understanding of Sui. Questions may cover topics like:  
- How does Sui achieve high throughput?  
- What is the role of the SUI token?  
- Key differences between Sui and other blockchains.  

A passing score unlocks the next task.  

### 3. Stake SUI on On-chain Earn  
Staking requires participants to **commit a minimum of 30 SUI** via OKXâ€™s On-chain Earn platform. This step aligns user incentives with network security, as staked tokens validate transactions on the Sui blockchain.  

**Why Stake?**  
- Earn additional rewards through staking yields.  
- Contribute to the decentralization of the Sui network.  

### 4. Hold SUI for 7 Days  
Finally, users must **maintain a net balance increase of 30 SUI** for seven consecutive days. This ensures long-term engagement with the ecosystem.  

**Example:**  
- Start with 20 SUI â†’ Stake 30 SUI = 50 SUI total.  
- Maintain at least 50 SUI in the wallet for one week.
