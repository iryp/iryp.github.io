## Frequently Asked Questions  

### Q: Is Bitcoin's $91,816 level a strong support zone?

A: XRP benefits from its utility in cross-border payments, Ripple's strategic partnerships, and ongoing regulatory progress. Investors should monitor SEC rulings in 2025 for further clarity.  

### Q: Should retail investors hold Dogecoin long-term?  
A: While DOGE's volatility remains high, its community-driven nature and meme culture relevance make it a speculative but potentially rewarding holding. Diversification is key.  

### Q: How does Solana's ecosystem compare to Ethereum?  
A: Solana offers faster transaction speeds and lower fees than Ethereum, attracting developers building scalable dApps. However, Ethereum's larger user base and institutional support give it an edge in market dominance.
